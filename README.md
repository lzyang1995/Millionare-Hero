# Millionare-Hero

A simple Millionare Hero like question answering app based on React, Redux, React Router and Ant Design Mobile UI framework, created with Create React App. The purpose is to get fimiliar with these frameworks.

The idea of this App is from this tutorial: <https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1T7411W72T?p=26>

## Usage

The app needs to fetch data from a server. So first we need to setup and start the server in `data_server` directory:

```bash
cd data_server
npm install
node index.js
```

Then in the main directory, run the following commands to start the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Run `npm run build` for production build. You can refer to [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) For more information about the commands.
